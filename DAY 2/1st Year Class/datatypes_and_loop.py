# 1) if else
#   -if else condition
n = 4
# if n > 3:
#     print("greater than 3")


#   -nested if else condition
# if n % 2 == 0:

# i = 5
# if i > 0:
#     print("postive")
# elif i == 0:
#     print("zero")
# else:
#     print("negative")

# question 2
# enter marks from user as an input and find he/she is pass or fail
# pass marks equal or greater than 40

# hint : dont forget type casting on input


# 2) while loop

n = "string"
i = 5

while i > 0:
    print(n)
    --i

# question 3
#  find sum of even no from 1 to 100
# variabe sum =0 i =100
# hint i%2 == 0  even no.
    # sum = sum + i

# i = i + 1
# ++i
# i += 1

# Assignment!!!!
# enter a year determine if it is leap year or not
# hint: should be divisible by 4 and should not be divisible by 100
# or be divisible by 400

# 3) for loop
